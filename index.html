                    I'd like to introduce myself as Shanthi Surampudi, an IT expert with eight years of experience and a bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Engineering.
                    At Texas A&M University Central-Texas, I'm earning a Master's degree in Computer Information Systems. Soon after starting the master's program,
                    I got a position as a Graduate Assistant at the Institutional Research Department, where I learned new tools and performed. In addition, in my first semester, I got a GPA of 4.
                    My blog, some projects I've worked on (and continue to work on), additional information about myself, and my CV can all be found in the upper right hand corner of this page. Have a great time!
                </p>
